YARP for BeagleBone black
===============

A bunch of files for the installation of YARP on BeagleBone black board (http://beagleboard.org). This files have been initiated by Francesco Nori when visiting the ISI laboratoy at the Univeristy of Tokyo (October 2015). The code requires the installation of Ubuntu 14.04 on the Beagle Bone black. Since no YARP binaries exist for ARM achitectures it is necessary to compile the software by downloading it from git.
